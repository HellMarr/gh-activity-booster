# github activity booster

If you are a recruiter, you should know that looking at the contributions infographics on people's profiles is absolutely useless, and this repository is the proof of it.

You can fork this project to add it on your profile; only there are a few things not to forget:
• Go to your repo → Settings → Actions → General
• Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
• Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
